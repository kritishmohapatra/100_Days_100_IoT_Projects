#  Servo Motor Control with Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (MicroPython)

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates **servo motor angle control** using **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** and **MicroPython**.  
The user can **enter an angle (0–180°)** via serial input, and the servo rotates accordingly.  
The system includes **angle validation, safe clamping, and debug print outputs**.

>  This is a **simulation / learning project**, intended for understanding PWM-based servo control logic.

##  Features
-  Serial input–based angle control  
-  Safe angle clamping (20°–170°)  
-  PWM-based servo control (50Hz)  
-  Debug output using `print()`  
-  Beginner-friendly & calibrated logic  

---

##  Components Used
- Raspberry Pi **Pico 2 W**
- Servo Motor (SG90 / equivalent)
- External 5V power supply
- Jumper wires

##  Pin Configuration
![Circuit Diagram](Circuit_Diagram/circuit_image.png)

| Servo Pin | Pico 2 W |
|---------|----------|
| Signal  | GPIO 15  |
| VCC     | External 5V |
| GND     | GND (Common) |

 **Important:**  
Servo motor must be powered using an **external 5V supply**.  
Pico and servo **GND must be common**.

---

##  Working Principle
- Servo motors operate using a **50Hz PWM signal**
- Angle input is mapped to a **PWM duty cycle**
- Due to **mechanical constraints**, most hobby servos safely operate between **20°–170°**
- Software-based **angle clamping** prevents mechanical damage
