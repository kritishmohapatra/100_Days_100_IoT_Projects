#  ESP8266 NTP Digital Clock (MicroPython)

An internet-synchronized digital clock built using **ESP8266** and a **TM1637 4-digit seven segment display**, implemented in **MicroPython**.  
The clock fetches accurate time from an **NTP server** and displays it in **HH:MM format** with a blinking colon.

##  Features
- Real-time clock using **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**
- No RTC module required
- Accurate internet-synced time
- Blinking colon effect
- Custom segment mapping for correct digit display
- Built using **MicroPython**
- Compact and low-cost design

##  Components Used
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- TM1637 4-Digit Seven Segment Display
- Wi-Fi Network
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

##  Pin Connections
![Circuit Diagram](Circuit_Diagram/circuit_image.png)

| TM1637 Pin | ESP8266 GPIO | NodeMCU Pin |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| CLK       | GPIO5        | D1          |
| DIO       | GPIO4        | D2          |
| VCC       | 3.3V         | 3.3V       |
| GND       | GND          | GND        |

##  How It Works
1. ESP8266 connects to the configured Wi-Fi network.
2. Time is fetched from an NTP server in UTC.
3. UTC time is converted to IST (UTC + 5:30).
4. Time is displayed on the TM1637 display in HH:MM format.
5. The colon blinks every second to indicate real-time updates.

##  Software & Libraries
- **MicroPython**
- `network` – Wi-Fi connection
- `ntptime` – NTP time synchronization
- `tm1637` – Seven segment display control

---

##  Setup Instructions
1. Flash MicroPython firmware on ESP8266.
2. Upload `tm1637.py` and `main.py` to the board.
3. Update Wi-Fi SSID and password in `main.py`.
4. Reset the ESP8266.
5. The clock will sync time and start displaying it automatically.

##  Custom Segment Mapping
Due to non-standard TM1637 module segment wiring, custom segment byte mapping is used to ensure correct digit rendering instead of relying on default library functions.
