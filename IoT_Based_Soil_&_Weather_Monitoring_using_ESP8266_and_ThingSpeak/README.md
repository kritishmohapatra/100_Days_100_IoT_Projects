# 🌱 IoT Based Soil & Weather Monitoring using ESP8266 and ThingSpeak

This project demonstrates an **IoT-based Soil Moisture and Weather Monitoring System** using **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)** programmed with **MicroPython**.  
The system reads **soil moisture**, **temperature**, and **humidity** data and uploads it to the **ThingSpeak cloud platform** for real-time visualization.

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 WiFi-enabled data transmission (ESP8266)
- 🌱 Soil moisture monitoring (analog sensor)
- 🌡 Temperature & 💧 Humidity monitoring (DHT11)
- ☁️ Live cloud dashboard using ThingSpeak
- 📊 Real-time graphical visualization
- 🧠 Beginner-friendly MicroPython code

---

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 (NodeMCU / ESP-12)
- Soil Moisture Sensor (Analog)
- DHT11 / DHT22 Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- WiFi (2.4 GHz)

### 🌱 Soil Moisture Sensor
| Sensor Pin | ESP8266 |
|----------|--------|
| VCC | 3.3V |
| GND | GND |
| AO  | A0 |

### 🌡 DHT11 Sensor
| Sensor Pin | ESP8266 |
|-----------|--------|
| VCC | 3.3V |
| DATA | D4 (GPIO2) |
| GND | GND |

## ☁️ ThingSpeak Setup

1. Create an account at **https://thingspeak.com**
2. Create a **New Channel**
3. Add fields:
   - Field 1 → Soil Moisture
   - Field 2 → Temperature
   - Field 3 → Humidity
4. Save the channel
5. Copy the **Write API Key**

---

## 🧠 Software Requirements

- MicroPython firmware for ESP8266
- Thonny IDE / uPyCraft
- Required libraries:
  - `network`
  - `urequests`
  - `dht`
  - `machine`

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. ESP8266 connects to the WiFi network
2. Reads:
   - Soil moisture from ADC (A0)
   - Temperature & humidity from DHT11
3. Sends data to ThingSpeak using HTTP GET request
4. ThingSpeak displays data as live graphs

## 📊 Output
![Dashboard](Circuit_Diagram/image.png)

- 📈 Live soil moisture graph  
- 🌡 Temperature graph  
- 💧 Humidity graph  

All data is visualized on the **ThingSpeak dashboard**.
