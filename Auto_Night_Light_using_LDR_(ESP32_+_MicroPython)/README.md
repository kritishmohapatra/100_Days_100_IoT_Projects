# 🌙 Auto Night Light using LDR (ESP32 + MicroPython)

An automatic night light system built using an **ESP32**, **LDR sensor**, and **MicroPython**.  
The LED automatically turns **ON** when it gets dark and **OFF** in bright light — a simple yet powerful IoT automation project.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project uses a **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)** to detect ambient light levels.  
The LDR and a fixed resistor form a **voltage divider**, and the ESP32’s **ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)** reads this voltage.  
Depending on the light intensity, the ESP32 decides whether to **turn the LED ON or OFF**.

**Voltage Divider:**
```
3.3V --- [LDR] ---●--- [10kΩ] --- GND
                  |
                ADC Pin (GPIO34)
```

**LED Connection:**
```
GPIO2 --- [220Ω Resistor] --- LED --- GND

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **LDR senses light intensity.**  
2. The **voltage divider** converts light intensity into an analog voltage.  
3. ESP32 reads this voltage through **ADC (pin 34)**.  
4. If the value is **below the threshold** → LED **turns ON** (dark).  
5. If the value is **above the threshold** → LED **turns OFF** (bright).

## ⚡ Calibration

1. Upload and run the code.  
2. Observe LDR values in **bright** and **dark** conditions (via serial monitor).  
3. Adjust `threshold` to a midpoint between those two values for best results.
