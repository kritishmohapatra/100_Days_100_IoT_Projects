# 📦 EEPROM Simulation using MicroPython on ESP32 (Wokwi)

This project demonstrates how to simulate EEPROM behavior on an ESP32 using **MicroPython** and the internal file system in Wokwi. Since ESP32 does not have true EEPROM, we emulate it using a binary file and implement byte-level read/write operations similar to Arduino EEPROM.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ EEPROM simulation using file storage  
- ✅ Byte-level read and write functions  
- ✅ String storage with null termination  
- ✅ Write-only-if-changed logic (reduces flash wear)  
- ✅ Persistent data across resets in Wokwi  
- ✅ Arduino EEPROM-style string handling

## 🧠 Concept

ESP32 does not contain real EEPROM. In this project:

- A binary file (`eeprom.dat`) acts as EEPROM memory  
- File index = EEPROM address  
- Each stored value = one byte  
- `0x00` is used as string terminator  
- File → EEPROM
- Index → Address
- Byte → Stored Data


---

## 🛠️ Technology Used

- ESP32  
- MicroPython  
- Wokwi Simulator  
- File-based persistent storage  

---

## 📂 Memory Configuration

```python
EEPROM_FILE = "eeprom.dat"
EEPROM_SIZE = 512
```
## 🔧 Functions Implemented

### EEPROM Core Functions

- **eeprom_init()** → Creates EEPROM file if not present  
- **eeprom_read_byte(addr)** → Reads one byte from address  
- **eeprom_write_byte(addr, val)** → Writes one byte to address  

---

### String Functions

**save_string(address, text)**

- Writes string byte-by-byte  
- Writes only if value changed  
- Adds null terminator  

**read_string(address)**

- Reads bytes until null byte found  
- Converts bytes back to string

## ▶️ How to Run (Wokwi)

1. Open Wokwi  
2. Create new **ESP32 MicroPython** project  
3. Paste code into `main.py`  
4. Click **Run**  
5. Enter string in serial console  
6. Restart simulation to verify persistence  

---

## 🧪 Example Output
```
Enter a string to save in EEPROM:
hello
String saved in EEPROM.
Stored Text in EEPROM: hello


Second run with same value:



Enter a string to save in EEPROM:
hello
String is same as previous one.
Stored Text in EEPROM: hello

```

## 🎯 Applications

- Device configuration storage  
- WiFi credential saving  
- User preferences  
- IoT node settings  
- Calibration values  

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Data persists across simulation restarts (unless storage is reset)  
- Max string length depends on `EEPROM_SIZE`  
- Designed for learning and simulation purposes  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Store integers and floats  
- JSON config storage  
- Encrypted EEPROM data  
- Wear leveling logic  
- OLED display integration
