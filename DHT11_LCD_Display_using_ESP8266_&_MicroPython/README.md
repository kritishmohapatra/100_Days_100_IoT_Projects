# 🌡️ DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Display using ESP8266 + I2C LCD (MicroPython)

---

## 🔍 Overview
This project measures **temperature** and **humidity** using the **DHT11 sensor** and displays the readings on a **16x2 I2C LCD** connected to an **ESP8266** microcontroller programmed in **MicroPython**.  
It provides smooth, real-time updates every 2 seconds without screen flicker.

## ⚙️ Circuit Diagram
![Circuit Diagram](Circuit_Diagram/circuit_image.png)
Below is the circuit connection layout used in this project:

| Component | ESP8266 Pin | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| DHT11 Data | GPIO 2 (D4) | Sensor data pin |
| LCD SDA | GPIO 4 (D2) | I2C data line |
| LCD SCL | GPIO 5 (D1) | I2C clock line |
| VCC | 3.3V / 5V | Power supply |
| GND | GND | Ground connection |

> 💡 **Note:** The I2C address (`0x27`) may vary depending on your LCD module. You can use an I2C scanner script to find the correct address.

## 🧩 Components Required
| Component | Quantity | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| ESP8266 (NodeMCU) | 1 | Microcontroller board running MicroPython |
| DHT11 Sensor | 1 | Measures temperature and humidity |
| 16x2 I2C LCD | 1 | Displays temperature and humidity values |
| Jumper Wires | - | For connections |
| Breadboard | 1 | For circuit assembly |

## ⚡ How It Works
1. The **DHT11 sensor** reads real-time temperature and humidity data.  
2. The **ESP8266** collects and processes this data using the `dht` module.  
3. The readings are displayed on the **16x2 I2C LCD**.  
4. Only numeric values are updated every 2 seconds — preventing flicker and keeping the display stable.
