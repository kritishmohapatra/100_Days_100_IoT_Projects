# Potentiometer Bar Graph with ESP32 (MicroPython)

This project reads analog input from a potentiometer and displays the level using 10 LEDs as a bar graph on the ESP32. The LED brightness increases proportionally with the potentiometer value, simulating a simple **analog-to-bar-graph** indicator.

## üß† Features

- Reads analog input from a potentiometer.  
- Maps ADC values (0‚Äì4095) to 10 LEDs.  
- Displays real-time bar graph of potentiometer level.  
- Prints analog value, level, and active LEDs to the serial monitor.

## üß© Working Principle

- The **ADC** (Analog to Digital Converter) reads a voltage between 0‚Äì3.3V.  
- This value (0‚Äì4095) is scaled into **10 levels**.  
- Each level lights up one LED, creating a bar-graph-like visualization.  
- Rotating the potentiometer gradually lights up or turns off LEDs.

## üì∑ Future Enhancements

- Replace LEDs with an OLED display bar visualization.  
- Implement smoothing or filtering for stable readings.  
- Add color LEDs (RGB) for visual effects.  
- Display the percentage value on the web server using MicroPython.
