# 🔌 IoT Relay Control Web Server (Raspberry Pi Pico 2W)

A simple and efficient **IoT-based relay control system** using **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** and **MicroPython**.  
This project hosts a **local web server** on the Pico 2W that allows users to control an electrical load (relay) using a **smooth slide switch web interface** over WiFi.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **IoT Relay Control Web Server** enables wireless control of a relay through a browser-based interface.  
The relay can be switched **ON / OFF** using a **modern slide switch**, and the current status is displayed in real time on the webpage.

This project demonstrates:
- Embedded Web Server
- WiFi connectivity using Pico 2W
- GPIO relay control
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration with MicroPython

## ⚙️ Features

- 🌐 Local web server hosted on Raspberry Pi Pico 2W  
- 🎚️ Smooth **slide switch UI** (no button toggles)  
- 🔁 Real-time relay ON/OFF control  
- 🟢 Live status indication on webpage  
- ⚡ Active-LOW relay support  
- 📱 Mobile & desktop browser compatible  
- 🚀 Fast response with minimal lag  

---

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W  
- 1-Channel Relay Module  
- External Load (Bulb / LED / Appliance)  
- Jumper Wires  
- WiFi Network

## 🔌 Pin Configuration
![Circuit Diagram](Circuit_Diagram/circuit_image.png)

| Component | Pico 2W Pin |
|---------|-------------|
| Relay IN | GP2 |
| Relay VCC | 5V |
| Relay GND | GND |

> ⚠️ Relay is **Active LOW** (LOW = ON, HIGH = OFF)

## 💻 Software Requirements

- MicroPython firmware for Raspberry Pi Pico 2W  
- Thonny IDE  
- Web Browser (Chrome / Edge / Mobile Browser)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Pico 2W connects to the configured WiFi network.
2. A socket-based web server starts on port **80**.
3. When the user accesses the IP address in a browser, a control webpage is loaded.
4. Sliding the switch sends `/on` or `/off` requests.
5. The relay GPIO pin is updated instantly.
6. Webpage status updates without refreshing.
