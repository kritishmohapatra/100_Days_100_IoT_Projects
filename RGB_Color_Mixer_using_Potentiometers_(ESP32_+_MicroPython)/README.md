#  RGB Color Mixer using Potentiometers (ESP32 + MicroPython)

##  Overview  
This project lets you **mix colors in real-time** using an **RGB LED** and **three potentiometers** connected to the **ESP32**.  
Each potentiometer controls one color channel — **Red**, **Green**, or **Blue** — and by adjusting them, you can create countless color combinations.

##  Hardware Required  
-  ESP32 development board  
-  RGB LED (Common Cathode or Common Anode)  
-  3 × 10kΩ potentiometers  
-  Jumper wires  
-  Breadboard  
- 3 x 220 ohm resistors

##  Circuit Connections  
![Circuit Diagram](Circuit_Diagram/circuit_image.png)


| Component | ESP32 Pin | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| RGB Red pin | 25 | PWM output for Red |
| RGB Green pin | 26 | PWM output for Green |
| RGB Blue pin | 27 | PWM output for Blue |
| Potentiometer (Red) | 36 | ADC input for Red |
| Potentiometer (Green) | 39 | ADC input for Green |
| Potentiometer (Blue) | 34 | ADC input for Blue |
| Common LED pin | GND (for Common Cathode) / 3.3V (for Common Anode) | — |

>  **Tip:** If your LED lights up in reverse (on when expected off), set `invert = True` in the code.

##  How It Works  

The ESP32 reads the position of each **potentiometer** using its **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**.  
Each potentiometer provides a voltage between **0V and 3.3V**, which is converted into a digital value between **0 and 4095**.

This value is then **mapped** to a **PWM duty cycle** (0–1023) to control the brightness of each LED color channel:

```python
# Convert ADC value (0–4095) to PWM duty (0–1023)
def map_adc_to_duty(x):
    return int(x * 1023 / 4095)
```

The **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** signal determines how bright the LED glows:  
- A **higher duty value** means the LED is **brighter**.  
- A **lower duty value** means the LED is **dimmer**.  

Each RGB color channel (Red, Green, Blue) is controlled independently:
```python
r = map_adc_to_duty(a_r.read())  # Red intensity
g = map_adc_to_duty(a_g.read())  # Green intensity
b = map_adc_to_duty(a_b.read())  # Blue intensity
```

Then, these values are applied to the PWM pins:
```python
p_r.duty(r)
p_g.duty(g)
p_b.duty(b)
```

By adjusting the potentiometers, you control the **mixing ratio** of Red, Green, and Blue light.  
When all three are combined in different intensities, you get different colors — just like how pixels on a display work!

>  Example:  
> - Full Red + Full Green = **Yellow**  
> - Full Green + Full Blue = **Cyan**  
> - Full Red + Full Blue = **Magenta**  
> - All Full = **White**

##  Color Mixing Examples  

| R | G | B | Output Color |
|---|---|---|---------------|
| 1023 | 0 | 0 |  Red |
| 0 | 1023 | 0 |  Green |
| 0 | 0 | 1023 |  Blue |
| 1023 | 1023 | 0 |  Yellow |
| 0 | 1023 | 1023 |  Cyan |
| 1023 | 0 | 1023 |  Magenta |
| 1023 | 1023 | 1023 |  White |
