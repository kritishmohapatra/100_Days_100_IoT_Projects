# Ultrasonic Distance Indicator using ESP32 (MicroPython)

A simple distance-based indication system using the **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** and **ESP32**, developed in **MicroPython**.  
The system indicates whether an object is **near or far** using **Red and Green LEDs**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor
- Displays distance on Serial Monitor
- Uses LEDs for visual indication:
  - 🟢 **Green LED** → Object is far
  - 🔴 **Red LED** → Object is near
- Simulated using **Wokwi Simulator**

---

## 🛠️ Components Used

- ESP32  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Red LED  
- Green LED  
- 220Ω Resistors  
- Jumper Wires  

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The HC-SR04 sensor sends an ultrasonic pulse through the **TRIG** pin.  
When the pulse hits an object, it reflects back and is received at the **ECHO** pin.  
The time taken for this round trip is used to calculate the distance.

Based on a predefined threshold:
- Distance > 20 cm → Green LED ON  
- Distance ≤ 20 cm → Red LED ON
